Filling Holes, Stacking walls, Replacing facades, Drawing paths, Making patterns, ...
There are plenty of uses for this rather simple gadget. 

With its configuration and upgrades, the **Handheld Blockzapper** can place and replace blocks at a distance.
* Start by [**Left-Clicking**] a Block within range to set it as the currently selected target Material.  
The tool will try to use this selected block for placing or exchanging.
* [**Right-Click**] while **Sneaking** to open the configuration screen.  
Here you can adjust whether to place or replace blocks, an area of effect, the pattern placed, and other settings.
* Once you're finished configuring, close the screen and [**Right-Click**] at blocks within range.  
The targeted blocks will be replaced or covered by the block you chose.
