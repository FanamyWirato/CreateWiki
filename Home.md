Welcome to the Create wiki!
Here you will find out about all the details on the features of this mod (in the future).
As of now, there are no written guides regarding most of the features in 0.1. The current version you're playing is in **very early beta** and a lot of the **fundamentals will change** in the next couple updates to the mod.  

Your best options to learn about this _demo_-version is to consult the following resources:
* The Mod **JEI** for showing the recipes and recipe types added in Create
* The **in-game tooltips** of Create for description of the individual blocks and items
* [This Collection of **videos**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyADkcfPLU8ywCXZPaDbQ_JZJL0CGDN5Z) showcasing different aspects of the Mod
* The [Feedback and Help](https://discordapp.com/invite/hmaD7Se) Channel for questions and suggestions.

Thank you for playing, and stay tuned for all the new possibilities in **beta 0.2**.
I am forever grateful for any bugs, enhancements and suggestions posted on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/simibubi/Create/issues).
