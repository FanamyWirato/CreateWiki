The Encased Fan is a mechanical component added by Create that functions as a tool for moving entities and items, as a generator, and as an essential component for bulk washing, bulk smelting, and bulk smoking.

## Pushing and pulling

When connected to [rotational force](The-Basics-of-Rotation-in-Create), an Encased Fan creates an air flow in the several blocks in front of it, which will either push or pull entities or items depending on the direction of rotation.

## Bulk item processing

When the air flow of an Encased Fan passes through [[water]], [[lava]], or [fire]], the air flow downstream of the relevant block will apply processing recipes to items that pass through. An air flow containing water will apply [bulk washing recipes](Bulk-Washing-Recipes), an air flow containing lava will apply any smelting recipe that can be applied in a [[Furnace]] but not a [[Smoker]], and an air flow containing fire will apply any recipe that can be applied in a Smoker. These recipes can be applied to items either in the world or on a [[Mechanical Belt]].

## Power generation

When an Encased Fan is placed facedown directly over a heat source (fire, lava, [[magma]], or a [[Campfire]]) and powered by [[redstone]], it will provide 32 [SU](Stress-Units%2C-Capacity-and-Impact) of rotational force at 16 RPM. This is tied with a [[Mechanical Bearing]] attached to a single block of [[wool]] as the most compact power source in Create.
