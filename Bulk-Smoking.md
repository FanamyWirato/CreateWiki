By placing fire or a campfire in the air stream of an [[Encased Fan]], smoking recipes can be applied to items in the world or on [[Mechanical Belts|Mechanical Belt]], similar to [[Bulk Smelting]] with lava in place of fire and [[Bulk Washing]] with water in place of fire. If implemented properly, the particles in the air stream will turn orange. A bulk smoker allows for rapid cooking of food without requiring the use of fuel.

Any recipe that can be applied in a standard smoker can be similarly applied in a bulk smoker.
