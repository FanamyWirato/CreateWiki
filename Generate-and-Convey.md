Using appropiate generators(link), you can start setting things in motion. These kinetic components will apply the speed they generate at to attached shafts, cogs, etc. Any component can be connected to any other, so long as their integrated shafts/cogs are linked together.

Multiple generators can be connected together in order achieve a greater Capacity score for the attached kinetic network. When attaching new generators to running components, it is important that the added generator rotates in the same direction as the component it is attached to. When connecting two kinetic blocks with incompatible direction of rotation, you'll notice that the blocks just break. However, trouble-shooting this will be quite straight-forward - all you need to do is to include a means of reversing the rotation between the generator and the rest:

Relaying rotational power between two components is one of the most important tasks when creating with Create. There are a variety of options and multiple possible solutions for each situation. These are the components that allow you to move, spread and modify rotational behaviour most effectively:

(mesh of these components showing off their behaviour)

Shafts, cheapest option for relaying in a straight line.
Cogwheels, move sideways while keeping the same rotation axis; reverse the direction
Belts, move sideways while while keeping the same rotation axis; cannot be vertical; do not reverse direction
Gearboxes, relay between two different rotation axes in a compact fashion; reverse connections on the same axis
Encased Belts, relay sideways and between different rotation axes; do not reverse direction
Best is play around with each component and familiarizing yourself with its abilities. It is important to know the options when having to deal with complex connection tasks in a potentially less forgiving environment.
