Some blocks and items in Create are either too large or too complex to be crafted in a mere 3x3 crafting grid. In order to craft them, you'll have to set up an array of Mechanical Crafters.

The Mechanical Crafter represents a single slot in a crafting recipe, and can be arranged adjacent to other Crafters to compose crafting grids of many sizes and shapes, up to a 9x9 grid. If arranged and powered correctly, all linked Crafters will eventually combine their ingredients into a final product. If arranged wrongly, they simply spill their contents out.

## Setting up

Each Crafter contains an internal cogwheel, able to receive and relay reversed rotation to adjacent components. This allows multiple linked Crafters to power each other when crafting a recipe.

Some crafting recipes, such as the Bucket, require ingredients to be arranged diagonally, leaving empty slots near them. The Crafter Slot Cover can be inserted into a Mechanical Crafter to mark it as an empty slot, allowing diagonal Crafters to be linked together.

A recipe output cannot exit a Crafter Slot Cover; it must exit a slot that holds an ingredient.
